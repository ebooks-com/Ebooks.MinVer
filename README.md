# MinVer

_[![nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MinVer.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MinVer)_
_[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0ai8j3x4tg6w3ima/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adamralph/min-ver/branch/master)_

A minimalistic [.NET package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MinVer) for versioning .NET projects using Git tags.

Platform support: [.NET Standard 1.3 and upwards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).

## Quick start

1. Remove any `Version` or `VersionPrefix` elements from your project. (You can keep `VersionSuffix`, but it should be restricted to [build metadata](https://semver.org/#spec-item-10) only.)
1. `dotnet add package MinVer`
2. `dotnet build`
3. Your project will be versioned according to the latest tag found in the commit history.

## How it works

### Inputs

- The last tag on HEAD or it's ancestors which represents a [SemVer](https://semver.org) version number._\*_
- By how many commits HEAD is ahead of the tag (known as "height")._\*\*_

\* _Each time the history diverges, the last tag is found on each path and the tag with the latest version number is used._

\*\* _Each time the history converges, the height on the first path followed is used._

### Algorithm

- If the height is zero (i.e. the tag is on HEAD), then the HEAD version matches the tag.
- If the height is non-zero (i.e. the tag is on an older commit), then:
  - If the last tag is an RTM version, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, then the HEAD version is `MAJOR.MINOR+1.PATCH-alpha.0.{height}`.
  - If the last tag is a pre-release version, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-{pre-release identifiers}`, then the HEAD version is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-{pre-release identifiers}.{height}`.

## FAQ

### Does MinVer work with my chosen branching strategy?

Yes! MinVer doesn't care about branches. It's all about the tags!

That means MinVer is compatible with [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), [Release Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow), and any other exotic flow.

### What if it all goes wrong?

If your tags get into a mess and you can't find a way out, you can temporarily switch off MinVer and switch back to the old way of doing things by simply adding a `Version` or `VersionPrefix` element to your project. When you've figure out the problem, remove the element and MinVer will resume active duty.

The same applies if you find a bug in MinVer (consider that a challenge!) and you're waiting for a fix, but you need to ship your software in the meantime.
